# Machine-Learning-Polynomial-Regression

###### The project

This project is an example of using datasets to perform a polynomial regression analysis in python with the help of matplotlib, numpy and sklearn. A throwing-of-a-ball dataset is used to perform polynomial regression to train, predict and plot results. In the dataset used, 14 observations are used for training and 6 observations are used for training the model. 

###### Usefulness

This project is useful in the sense that it provides a base understanding of how a dataset can be used for testing a model, trainging a model and performing a polynomial regression analysis that is necessary in understanding the non-linear relationship between variables.

###### Running the program

Getting the program to work is fairly simple and works as follows:

* You will need to install SciPy, Numpy, Matplotlib and Sci-Kit Learn. For more information on installing python packages see https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/
* Download poly.py
* Run the code in an IDE that supports python
* A new window will open up with a figure displaying the polynomial relationship of a simulated throwing of a ball (height in metres versus distance travelled in metres)
